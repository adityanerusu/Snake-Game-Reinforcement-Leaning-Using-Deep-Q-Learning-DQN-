# Snake-Game-Reinforcement-Leaning-Using-Deep-Q-Learning-DQN-
This project uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to train an AI agent to play Snake autonomously. Implemented with Python, Pygame, and PyTorch, the agent learns to navigate, consume food, and avoid obstacles through experience replay and a reward system. Results highlight DQN's success in dynamic environments, showcasing reinforcement learning's potential.

Run the agent.py file in command prompt using "python agent.py" command for autonomus gameplay

Run the snake_game_human.py file for manual playing
